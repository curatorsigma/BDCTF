Look into the finite field GF(2) and linearly independent vectors as well as bitwise XOR (for the ints resulting from the hash)
You can add Comments to change the hash and leave the file contents intact. Try '#i' for i an int.
Find such Comments that give you some of the bits for the final XOR-result and add them accordingly.
