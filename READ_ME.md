# The Challenges:
In ascending order of difficulty:

## Loophole_Warmup
You find yourself in an odd paralell Universe. Everything is so close, yet achieving your goals can still be so far off.
Find a hole in the defense and get the Flag!

## Logic_Smash
Its simple: you give us the input, and if the error is far enough off, we may just not smash your face. Get the Error to 00000000 to get the flag.

## Twist_and_Seed
The well known Mersenne-Twister with a twist. Something is off with these randomly generated multifactor authentification tokens. Find the pattern, hack the planet, Profit?

## Crypto_Crisis
We all goof up sometimes. Find the Problem in the Codesnippet and figure out a way to get your script executed.
